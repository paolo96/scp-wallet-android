# Terms of use

By using SCP Wallet mobile application (the “App”), you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using the App.

We intend for users to be able to use the functionality of the App on a decentralized, anonymous basis. You acknowledge and agree that SCP Wallet is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any ScPrime transaction initiated via the Services, including but not limited to use of any incorrect address or the loss of your private key.

## How Your Wallet Works 
Your SCP is held in your SCP Wallet in the “designed form”, recorded on the ScPrime blockchain. When you create a Wallet, the software on your phone generate and store a cryptographic private key (seed) that you may use to send and receive SCP via the ScPrime Blockchain network.

## Your Seed

The seed must be used in connection with the wallet to authorize the transfer of SCP from or to that wallet address. The private key is stored on your mobile device. Importantly, your private key provides access to and security for your SCP. We have no access to your private key and may not, under any circumstance, initiate a transaction using your private key on your behalf. If you lose your private key, we cannot recover it for you.

The seed and other sensible information is encrypted twice. First with your device provided encryption (such as the Android keystore system), it is then further encrypted with the password you provide at wallet creation.

## Liability

In no event shall SCP Wallet or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on SCP Wallet, even if SCP Wallet or his representatives have been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.

SCP Wallet may revise these terms of service for its website at any time without notice. By using the service you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.
